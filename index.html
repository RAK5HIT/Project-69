<p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restraunt tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi Cafe" while you are on the main road. The restraunt has a reasonably good menu at reasonably good prices. The food is delicious, the serving are quite large and can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid dissapointments. One other days, the crowd is pretty hyped and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater feast", which you mst attend if possible.</p>

<p class="text-muted text-left">It is a wonerful place. Must visit this place. Most haired tour guide so it will be better to understand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls It's a historical site famous among tourists =. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of 15 rs but its Rs. 225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago </p>

  <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you'll miss 40% of the fun. At minimum:Infinity War , Civil War, Black panther:Wakanda , Age of Ultron ,Ant man and the wasp this movie is the homage to all the movies.
    Yet you will enjoy alot. There is at the beggining of the movie a (Spoier Alert!!) ....Watch at your own risk..... 
    head dismemberment that is quite impressivr. But most ith comic book style figand battles. Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worth while.

    <p>It's definitely worth seeing. There's modified dialogue and added scenes, plus they've made the lions more “lion-like” rather than “human-like”. Parts of it were done better than the original, but, like with any remake, there were parts that were questionable. But still worth the watch!</p>

    <p>While the original still looked absolutely beautiful, the sequel pushes the boundaries even further. Stunning bodies of water, ice sculptures, and even Elsa undergo a transformation that looks great. There's nothing in this movie that looks poor. Everything in Frozen 2 is simply gorgeous from start to finish.</p>

        <img src="el.jpeg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> In an attempt to be more environmentaly responsible, LEGO have said that they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options which could include hemp. According to Telegraph world, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective clicking together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured blocks.
